    <title>HTML practice: Week 1</title>
</head>
<body><h1>Basic structure uses</h1>HTML and CSS are markup languages. Markup languages are not programming languages.
    <p>There is no logic or processing of data in the lines of Python of Javascript within a HTML page. HTML is merely a representative
        of data/information.
        HTML documents should always include the language declaration, a header containing the metadata of the webpage, a title which is
        shown in the browser's title bar and the body of information that is visible on screen to the user.
        We can create headings, ordered and unordered lists and insert images, videos, games and other content into our code to 
        make it visible in the content for the user.<br>
        <h1>Headers</h1>
            Headers range in size from H1 to H6. H1 is the largest font type. You don't need to use a p or br tag to ensure
            spacing between your header and text. This is done automatically as part of the header tag. Can be used to have control over the spacing.<br>
        <h4>List of things I need to do today.</h4>
        Create an ordered an unordered list of jobs. Ordered lists are numbered and unordered lists are bulleted and used for when the order does not matter.
        <p class="todo-list">
            <ul>
                <li>Clean the bathroom</li>
                <li>Sort out the menu for the week</li>
                <li>Look at stuff for Sally's birthday</li>
                <li>Finish all of the content I'm behind in</li>
            </ul><br>I should probably use an ordered list for this so I can list them in order of importance.
            <ol>
                <li>Finish all of the content I'm behind in</li>
            <li>Sort out the menu for this week</li>
        <li>Clean the bathroom</li>
    <li>Look at stuff for Sally's birthday</li>
</ol>
<p>Ordered lists are good if you are providing instruction; for example, steps in a recipe. Unordered lists are fine for listed information where a numbered format is not required.
<br>I also found out I'm going to India next month!<p class="india-taj">
    I will get to see the Taj Mahal!

    This image has been inserted directly from another website by copying the URL. Another way to imbed an image into your HTML code is using a local image saved to your computer.<br>

    You can use semantic HTML elements throughout your webpage. These help convey meaning about the content they enclose. This is helpful for browers and web developers.<br>
    Some examples are article, section, header, main, details, summary etc. These aren't visible to the user.<br>
    Another example is figure/figcaption - this specifies self-contained content, like images, and figcaption provides a caption. I have also noticed that these have a margin when you insert them too.
