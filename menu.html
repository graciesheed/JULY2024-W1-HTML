    <ol>
<li>In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil. Add onion and leek and sauté until fragrant and translucent. Add ½ of the celery and sauté 1-2 more minutes.</li>
<li>Add chicken thighs to pot and add broth, water, salt, bay leaves and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 30 min until the chicken can be easily shredded.</li>
<li>Transfer chicken to a cutting board and shred using two forks.</li>
<li>Add the chicken back to the broth along with the rice and other half of the celery. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until the rice is completely cooked and veryyyy soft.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl whisk the eggs, lemon juice and zest together until very frothy and almost thickened, this will take 2-3 minutes.</li>
<li>Next, temper the egg mixture. Very slowly, add a ladle of hot broth into the egg mixture one spoonful at a time, whisking to combine. Continue adding a spoonful of broth at a time until the egg mixture is hot as well, about ⅓ of the soup.</li>
<li>Turn the heat off on the stove.</li>
<li>Slowly pour the egg/broth mixture back into the soup pot and give it a good mix. The soup should be nicely thickened.</li>
<li>Ladle into a bowl and serve with a drizzle with the lemon olive oil, big crack of freshly ground pepper and plenty of dill fronds. Ahhh, enjoy!</li>

<p>Ingredients
    <ul>
    <li>2 firm white fish fillets (about 5 oz / 150g each), skin off, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 tbsp dijon mustard (sub mayo)</li>
    <li>Olive oil spray</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
<i>CRUMB</i>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1 tbsp parsley , finely chopped</li>
<li>1/3 cup (30g) parmesan , finely grated</li>
<li>1 garlic clove , minced</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
<p>Instructions
<ol>
<li>Preheat grill / broiler on high.</li>
<li>Combine the Crumb ingredients and mix well to combine.</li>
<li>Sprinkle both sides of fish with salt and pepper, then spread the mustard on the top of each fillet (top only).</li>
<li>Press the mustard smeared side of the fish into the crumb mixture. Press down firmly to make it stick. Then spray with oil (for extra golden crumb!).</li>
<li>Drizzle 1/2 tbsp oil in a skillet and preheat on the stove over high heat.</li>
<li>Once skillet is hot, place the fillets in the hot pan then place under the grill / broiler (about 5"/15cm from the heat source) for 5 - 6 minutes until the crumb is golden and the fish is cooked, rotating as required. Fish should flake in centre once cooked.</li>
<li>Oven option: bake at 220C/390F for 10 - 12 minutes, then finish under the grill/broiler on high to make the crumb golden.</li>
<li>Serve immediately with lemon wedges!</li>
